# Toka Language Specification for AI Developer

This document formalizes the Toka programming language specification based on the design draft. It aims to serve as the reference manual for implementing the Toka compiler.

## 1. Design Philosophy
- **Explicit Mutability & Nullability**: Controlled via orthogonal "Attribute Tokens" (`#`, `?`, `!`) rather than separate keywords.
- **Ownership & Borrowing**: compile-time memory safety similar to Rust but with a unique syntax.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in `Task` and `Channel` primitives with explicit lock types for shared state.

## 2. Lexical Structure

### 2.1 Keywords (Total: < 50)
Compiler parser should treat these as reserved.

**Declaration & Types**
- `auto`: Variable declaration start.
- `type`: Type alias.
- `const`: Constant declaration.
- `shape`: Unified structure/layout definition.
- `trait`: Interface definition.
- `impl`: Implementation block.
- `fn`: Function/Method declaration.
- `new`: Heap allocation (`auto ^p = new Person{...}`).
- `dyn`: Dynamic dispatch marker for Traits.
- `move`: Explicit ownership transfer.
- `where`: Type constraints.
- `default`: Use default trait implementation.
- `delete`: Explicitly remove a trait method (contract violation, note implementation warning).
- `final`: Seal implementation or method.
- `Fn`: Synchronous function type.

**Control Flow**
- `if`, `else`, `match`, `pass`
- `for`, `while`, `loop`, `break`, `continue`
- `return`, `yield`

**Concurrency**
- `Task`, `suspend`, `async`, `await`, `cancel`
- `Channel` (Library type, but core concept)

**Modules & Visibility**
- `import`: Import modules.
- `pub`: Public visibility modifier.

**Type & Logic**
- `as` (Cast), `is` (Type check), `in` (Membership/Iteration)
- `self`, `Self`
- `true`, `false`, `none`, `null`
- `defer`: Lazy initialization.
- `main`: Entry point.

### 2.2 Symbols & Operators
- `()`: Grouping, Arguments, Tuples, Object initialization.
- `[]`: Arrays only.
- `{}`: Blocks, Scopes.
- `^`: Pointer prefix (e.g., `^Person`).
- `#`: **Write Token** (Writable Content / Swappable Address).
- `?`: **Null Token** (Nullable: `none` for objects, `null` for pointers).
- `!`: **Write + Null Token** (Writable/Swappable + Nullable).
- `$`: **None Token** (Immutable & Non-null), usually omitted.
- **Literal Defaults**: 
    - Integer literals without suffix: `i32`.
    - Floating point literals without suffix: `f64`.
- `<-`: Dependency / Channel receive (Context dependent).
- `??`: **Null Assertion** (Prefix for pointer, Suffix for value).
- `&`: **Reference prefix** (e.g., `auto &r = &x#`).
- `++` / `--`: **Increment/Decrement** (Prefix and Postfix).
- `.`: Access.
- `:`: Type annotation.
- `;`: **Optional Statement Terminator**.

### 2.3 Semicolon Rules (Optional Semicolons)
Toka supports semicolon-less syntax. A semicolon is required ONLY to separate multiple statements on the same line.
- **Statement Termination**: A newline acts as a terminator unless the previous token is an operator or delimiter that expects continuation.
- **Continuation Rule**: If a line ends with an operator (e.g., `+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `=`, `,`, `.`, `->`, `::`, `(`, `[`, `{`), the next line is considered a continuation of the same statement.
- **Example**:
  ```scala
  auto x = 10    // OK: Newline terminates
  auto y = 1 +   // OK: '+' at end means continuation
           2
  ```

## 3. Type System & Attribute Tokens

### 3.1 The Attribute Token System (Core Feature)
Toka separates **storage binding** (`auto`) from **memory properties** (Tokens).

| Token | Meaning on Object | Meaning on Pointer (`^`, `*`, `~`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `#` | **Writable** (Content) | **Swappable** (Identity/Address) |
| `?` | **Nullable Slot** (Content) | **Nullable Slot** (Identity/Address) |
| `!` | **Writable + Nullable**. | **Swappable + Nullable**. |
| `$` | **Immutable + Non-null**. | **Fixed + Non-null**. |

**Syntax Rules:**
- Tokens are suffixes to the variable name (e.g., `auto x# = ...`).
- For pointers, tokens can attach to the pointer symbol `^` AND the variable name, creating 16 combinations (e.g., `auto ^#p?`).
    - `^#`: Pointer address is swappable (can point elsewhere).
    - `p?`: Object content is nullable (can be `none`).
    - *Clarification*: `auto ^?ptr#` = Nullable non-swappable pointer, pointing to a Writable non-nullable object.

#### 3.1.1 Reseat vs. Mutation
Toka distinguishes between changing **where** a pointer points and **what** it points to.
- **Reseat (Identity Change)**: `p = ...` or `*p = null`. 
    - Requires **Morphology `#` or `!`** (e.g., `^#` or `^!`).
    - If the source is `null`, Morphology must also permit a null slot (`?` or `!`).
- **Mutation (Content Change)**: `p.field = ...`.
    - Requires **Value `#` or `!`** (e.g., `p#` or `p!`).
    - If the source is `none`, Value must also permit a none slot (`?` or `!`).

### 3.2 Basic Types
- `i8`..`i64`, `u8`..`u64`, `f32`, `f64`
- `bool`, `char`, `str` (String)
- `void` (Unit)

### 3.3 The Five-State Shape System
Toka replaces separate `struct`, `enum`, and `option` keywords with a single **`shape`** keyword. A shape defines a physical memory layout and can represent five distinct forms.

#### 3.3.1 Struct Shape (Named Fields)
Standard record type with named fields.
```scala
shape Line(x: i32, y: i32)
```
**Initialization**: `auto l = Line(x=10, y=20)`

#### 3.3.2 Tuple Shape (Positional Fields)
Fields are accessed by index or destructuring.
```scala
shape Point(i32, i64)
```
**Initialization**: `auto p = Point(10, 20)`

#### 3.3.3 Array Shape (Fixed Size)
A fixed-length contiguous sequence.
```scala
shape Nums[i32; 5]
```
**Initialization**: `auto n = Nums[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` (uses standard array index expr)

#### 3.3.4 Tagged Union Shape (Enum / Option)
Also known as an ADT. Each variant has a **Tag** (physical value) and an optional **Payload**.
```scala
shape Maybe(
    One(i64) = 1 | 
    None = 0
)
```
- **Physical Layout (Scheme A: Natural Alignment)**:
    - **Tag**: 1 byte (Offset 0).
    - **Padding**: Variable (to align Payload).
    - **Payload**: Starts at the next naturally aligned offset (e.g., Offset 8 for `i64`).
    - **Total Size**: Determined by max alignment requirements (e.g., 16 bytes for `Maybe(One(i64))`).
- **Access Rule**: MUST be accessed via `match` or `if auto`. No direct member access.

#### 3.3.5 Bare Union Shape
A C-style union where all members share the same memory. No tag is stored.
```scala
shape Bytes4(
    as u32 |
    as (u8, u8, u8, u8) |
    as (head: u16, mid: u8, tail: u8)
)
```
- **Physical Layout**: Size is `max(sizeof(members))`. Alignment is `max(alignof(members))`.
- **Access Rule**: MUST specify the interpretation using `as`.
- **Example**: `auto (&r, &g#, &b, &a) = val as shape(u8, u8, u8, u8)`.

---

### 3.4 Pattern Matching & Expressions

#### 3.4.1 The `match` Expression
`match` is an expression that yields a value via `pass`.

**Binding Sovereignty (Physical Contract):**
- `auto One(v)`: **Copy**. Creates a new stack variable and copies the payload.
- `auto One(&v)`: **Reference (Read-only)**. `v` is an alias to the original payload memory.
- `auto One(&v#)`: **Mutable Reference**. `v` provides write access to the original payload memory.
- `auto One(v#)`: **Mutable Copy**. Copies payload to a new mutable stack variable.

**Syntax Example:**
```scala
auto res = Maybe::One(12)
match res {
    auto Maybe::One(&v) => {
        println("got One ref={}", v)
    }
    Maybe::None => println("got None")
}
```

#### 3.4.2 The `pass` Keyword & Type Softening
`pass` delivers a value from a block.
- **Rules**: Must be the last effective action in a block. 
- **Physical Reality**: `pass` is a **Zero-cost Abstraction**. It merely stores the result of the block expression into a pre-allocated "Result Alloca" in the parent scope.
- **Type Softening**: If one branch matches `T` and another matches `none`, the resulting type is inferred as `T!` (Nullable).

#### 3.4.3 Expression-based `if`
```scala
auto x = if val > 0 { pass val } else { pass 1 }
```
- If the target variable (e.g., `x`) expects a value, all branches MUST end with `pass`.
- `pass none` is required for optional branches to satisfy the type requirement.

#### 3.4.2 Loop Expressions & `or` Fallback
When a `for` or `while` loop is used as an expression, it must provide a fallback value in case the loop completes normally (without a `break`). This is done using the `or` block.
```scala
auto val = for auto x in list {
    if x > 10 {
        break x  // Loop terminates, val becomes x
    }
} or {
    pass -1      // Loop finished normally, val becomes -1
}
```
*Note*: `loop` does not require an `or` block because it is either infinite or must be terminated by a `break` with a value.

#### 3.4.3 Targeted Control Flow (Labels)
Loops can be targeted by `break` and `continue` using the name of the variable receiving the loop's value as a label.
```scala
auto result = loop {
    for auto i in [1, 2, 3] {
        if i == 2 {
            break to result 42 // Hits the 'loop' directly
        }
    }
}
```
If no label is provided, `break` and `continue` target the innermost loop.

### 3.5 Traits & Implementation
- **Definition**: Trait names are prefixed with `@` in definitions and usage.
  ```scala
  trait @Draw {
      fn draw(self) -> i32
  }
  ```
- **Implementation**:
  - **Inherent Methods**: `impl Type { ... }`
  - **Trait Implementation**: `impl Line@Draw { ... }`
  - **Multiple Traits**: `impl Type@{Trait1, Trait2} { ... }` (Planned)
  - **Default/Delete**: Methods can be marked `= default` or `= delete` (Planned).
  
### 3.6 Modules System
- **Module Identity**: File path based. E.g., `tests/lib.tk` is module `lib` (or fully qualified via path).
- **Import Syntax**:
  - `import path/to/file`: Imports the module. Symbols are accessed via namespace `file::symbol`.
  - `import path/to/file::*`: Imports the module and brings all `pub` symbols into current scope.
  - `import path/to/file::Symbol`: Imports specific symbol.
  - `import path/to/file::{A, B}`: Destructuring import.
- **Visibility**:
  - `pub`: Makes a top-level declaration (fn, struct, type, trait) visible to importers.
  - **Private by default**: Without `pub`, symbols are only visible within the declaring file.
- **Resolution**:
 [Physical Path] --resolve--> [Module] --filter--> [Visibility] --bind--> [Scope]

## 4. Memory Model

### 4.1 Ownership & Move Semantics
- **Copy vs Move**:
    - By default, assignment implies **copy**.
    - If a type is `[#no_bit_copy]`, copy is via `clone`.
    - Variable at last usage (R-value): `move`.
    - Variable as L-value ending scope: `drop`.
- **Optimization & Capture Passing (In-place Capture ABI)**:
    - **Physical Rule**: Function arguments that are **Shapes (Structs/Tuples/Arrays)** or marked as **Mutable (`#`)** are passed as **Addresses** (pointers) in the LLVM IR, even if they appear as "pass-by-value" in source.
    - **Invisible Implementation**: Inside the function, these arguments are registered as **Implicit Pointers** (`isImplicitPtr = true`).
    - **Semantic Symmetry**: The source code treats them as values, but the CodeGen performs an automatic **Soul Extraction** (Load) before any access, ensuring "Value Semantics" are maintained over "Pointer Reality".
    - **Raw Pointers**: Raw pointers (`*T`) are treated as primitive values (Address Integer) and passed by value, NOT by address (unless captured for mutation).
    - Immutable primitives remain simple pass-by-value (copy).

### 4.2 Explicit Mutation Requirement
- To modify any value, the **Write Token (`#`)** is MANDATORY at usage site.
  - `vec#.push(item)`
  - `x# = x + 1`
- This makes mutation explicit and searchable.

### 4.3 Pointers & References
- **Pointer (`^T`)**: Comparison with C++:
    - `^T` ≈ `T* const` (Fixed pointer, immutable data)
    - `^#T` ≈ `T*` (Swappable pointer, immutable data)
    - `^T#` ≈ `T* const` but data is mutable? (Needs strict verification with compiler rules)
    - *Doc Standard*: `auto ^p = new T` (Ownership root).
- **Reference**: 
    - Explicitly created using `&` (e.g., `auto &ref = &var#`).
    - References are **fixed** (cannot be reseated) and **non-nullable**.
    - Must abide by **Rule 406**: In-place access to the original variable is restricted during the lifetime of a mutable reference.
- **Increment/Decrement**:
    - Supported for any mutable memory location (Variable, Member, Index).
    - **Postfix (`x++`)**: Returns the value **before** the operation.
    - **Prefix (`++x`)**: Returns the value **after** the operation.

### 4.4 Toka Morphology (Raw Pointer 1.3 Specification)
Toka uses a "Point-Value Duality" morphology system to distinguish between a pointer's **Identity** (the address it holds) and its **Entity** (the memory it points to).

#### 4.4.1 Identity vs. Entity
- **Entity Access (`p`)**: Refers to the **pointed-to memory** (the soul).
    - `p.field`: Accesses fields of the object.
    - `p[0]`: Dereferences to the value (for scalars).
    - `p[i]`: Array access.
    - Used predominantly in **Entity Scopes** where the variable's type determines the layout.
- **Identity Access (`*p`, `^p`, `~p`)**: Refers to the **pointer itself** (the handle/address).
    - `*p`: Accesses the **raw memory address** stored in the variable.
    - `^p`: Accesses the **unique ownership handle**.
    - `~p`: Accesses the **shared control block**.
    - `*p = null`: Reseats the pointer to a new address.
    - `printf("%p", *p)`: Prints the address stored in `p`.

#### 4.4.2 Pointer Morphology & Attributes
Toka uses suffixes on the morphology symbol to control the pointer variable's behavior.

| Pattern | Meaning | Identity Binding (`*p`) | Entity Access (`p`) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `auto *p` | Non-swappable raw pointer | Single Load (Address) | Double Load (Value) |
| `auto *#p` | **Swappable** identity | `*p = addr` (Update Slot A) | Double Load (Value) |
| `auto *?p` | **Nullable** identity | `*p = null` | Double Load (Value) |
| `auto *!p` | Swappable + Nullable | `*#p = addr/null` | Double Load (Value) |

**Important (Inverted Logic)**:
- `*p` (Identity): Accesses the **Pointer Slot** (Slot A). Returns the address.
- `p` (Soul/Entity): Accesses the **Data Slot** (Slot B). Returns the pointed-to value.
- **Member Access**: `self.*buf` retrieves the address stored in `buf`. `self.buf` retrieves the value pointed to by `buf`.

#### 4.4.3 The Physical Soul Protocol (Address Layering)
Toka CodeGen implements the **Address Layering Protocol** to manage symbol resolution:

1.  **Identity Layer (`getIdentityAddr`)**:
    - Returns the `alloca` instruction (the stack slot / handle).
    - This is the **Stationary Address** of the variable.
2.  **Soul Layer (`getEntityAddr`)**:
    - Returns the **Data Pointer**.
    - If `isImplicitPtr` or `isExplicitPtr` is `true`, it performs an automatic `load ptr, ptr %identity` to retrieve the soul from the shell.
    - If not a pointer, it returns the `Identity` directly (Identity = Soul).

**The Physical Model Guide:**

| Concept Layer | LLVM Expression | CodeGen API | Usage Context |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Identity (躯壳)** | `alloca` / handle ptr | `getIdentityAddr()` | Reseat, Drop, Move, `&ref` |
| **Soul (灵魂)** | Data Block ptr | `getEntityAddr()` | Member access `.`, Arry `[]`, `genExpr` |

**Contract**: All field accesses (`GEP`) and data operations must be performed on the **Soul** address. All ownership transfers (Move/Drop) must be performed on the **Identity** address (to allow nulling).

### 4.5 Memory Management Hooks (MAGIC)
Toka delegates memory management to the standard library via specific "Magic Hooks".

- **Allocation**:
    - `auto ^p = new T(...)`: For Smart Pointers (`^`, `~`). Memory is managed automatically.
    - `auto *p = unsafe alloc T(...)`: For Raw Pointers (`*`). Memory must be managed manually.
- **Deallocation**: 
    - `free *p`: Explicitly release memory for **Raw Pointers** (`*`) only.
    - **Crucial**: Notice that `free` handles the **Soul** address for deallocation. Manual `free` is forbidden for smart pointers (`^`, `~`) as the compiler inserts drop glue automatically.

#### 4.5.1 C Interop (libc_ Prefix)
The compiler follows a naming convention for C functions:
- Symbols starting with `libc_` (e.g., `libc_malloc`, `libc_free`) automatically have the prefix stripped during CGS (Code Generation Stage). 
- `extern fn libc_malloc(...)` links directly to `malloc` in the C standard library.
- This prevents keyword conflicts (like `free`) while maintaining clean Toka code.

## 5. Concurrency Model

### 5.1 Tasks
- **Task**: First-class citizen.
- `auto t = task_obj.async`: Start immediate.
- `auto t = task_obj.suspend`: Create lazy task.
- `t.await`: Block/Yield until result.
- **Return Type**: `await` returns `Enum(Result, AsyncError)`.

### 5.2 Locks & Shared State
- Shared mutable pointers (`^#T#`) MUST specify a lock strategy in declaration.
- **Lock Types**:
    - `mutex` (Mutex), `rwlock` (Read-Write), `spinlock` (Spinlock), `atomic`, `nolock` (Unsafe).
- **Usage**:
    - Lock acquisition is **implicit** via the `#` token scope or `oncelock{}` blocks.
### 3. Permissions & Attributes System (Detailed)

Toka uses a **Host-Based Permission Inheritance** system with **Explicit Slot Overrides**, sticking to the "Immutable by Default" philosophy.

#### 3.1 Terminology
- **Host**: The container holding an entity or pointer (e.g., a scope, a struct instance).
- **Embedded Entity**: A value stored directly in the host.
- **Embedded Pointer**: A pointer stored in the host.
- **Pointed-to Entity**: The value pointed to by a pointer.
- **Identity (`*p`)**: The pointer variable itself (the address).
- **Entity (`p`)**: The content pointed to.

#### 3.2 Inheritance & Blocking Rules
1.  **Host Inheritance**: Entities and Pointers (Identity) inherit the permissions of their Host.
    -   If Host is **Read-Only** (default), members are Read-Only.
    -   If Host is **Writable** (marked `#`), members are Writable.
2.  **Pointer Blocking**: Inheritance **stops** at the Pointer boundary.
    -   The **Pointed-to Entity** does NOT inherit the Host's permissions.
    -   It defaults to **Read-Only** (Safe default).
    -   Use `*p#` to explicitly make the entity mutable.
3.  **Scope Host**: The local scope acts as a Host that is always **Read-Only** (for entities) or **Fixed** (for pointers) by default. You must declare variables with `#` to open a writable slot.

#### 3.3 Explicit Slot Symbols
-   `#` (Mutable Slot): **Always Writable**. Overrides Host's Read-Only constraint (Interior Mutability).
-   `$` (Const Slot): **Always Read-Only**. Overrides Host's Writable permission.
-   **Host Inheritance**: Members inherit the permissions of their Host (e.g. if `p` is `Data#`, `p.v` is writable by default).
-   **Pointer Blocking**: Inheritance **stops** at the Pointer boundary. Pointed-to entities default to Read-Only unless explicitly marked (e.g. `*p#`).

#### 3.4 Pointer Morphology Examples
| Syntax | Identity (`*p`) | Entity (`p`) | Semantics |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `auto *p` | Fixed | Read-Only | Const pointer to const data |
| `auto *#p` | **Rebindable** | Read-Only | Mutable pointer to const data |
| `auto *p#` | Fixed | **Mutable** | Const pointer to mutable data |
| `auto *#p#` | **Rebindable** | **Mutable** | Mutable pointer to mutable data |

*(Note: `*p1` behaves as `*p1$` for the entity part due to blocking)*

### 5. Nullability Handling (The `is` and `??` Operators)
**Mechanisms**: Toka uses `is` for safe unwrapping and `??` for direct assertion.
-   **Discarded/Forbidden**: `if auto` (ambiguous), `== null` checks (unsafe).
-   **Syntax**: `if Source is Target { ... }`
    -   **Source Expression**: `^?p` (matches the declaration pattern of the nullable variable).
    -   **Target Expression**: `^p` (matches the desired non-nullable pattern).
    -   **Actual Code**: `if ^?p is ^p { ... }`.
    -   **Semantics**: Checks if variable `p` (declared as `auto ^?p`) is not null.
    -   **Deep Conversion**: `if ~!ptr? is ~ptr`.
-   **Type Narrowing (Sema Rule)**: Inside the `then` branch of an `is` check, the compiler must temporarily narrow the source variable's type.

#### 5.2 Direct Assertion (`??`)
-   **Prefix `??p`**: Asserts that identity `p` (pointer) is not null. Returns `^T`.
-   **Suffix `val??`**: Asserts that `val` (optional) contains a value. Returns `T`.
-   **Runtime**: Emits a Panic if the check fails.

### 6. Encapsulation (@encap)
Toka uses a centralized access control mechanism via the `@encap` trait implementation.

#### 6.1 The @encap Block
Access control is NOT defined inline with field declarations. Instead, it is defined in an `impl Type@encap` block.
- **Fields default to private**: Any field not mentioned in the `@encap` block is only visible within the file it was defined.
- **`pub` field**: Visible to anyone who imports the module.
- **`pub(crate)` field**: Visible within the same package.
- **Exclusion Syntax**: `pub * ! field1, field2` means everything is public EXCEPT the listed fields (Reserved for future).

```scala
impl Device@encap {
    pub public_config
    pub(crate) crate_shared
}
```

#### 6.2 Implementation Rules
- Only ONE `@encap` block is allowed per type.
- The `@encap` block must be in the same module as the type definition.
- Methods can also be subjected to encapsulation (Planned).

### 7. C Interop and the `libc_` Prefix
Toka interacts with the C world using `extern` functions.
- **Symbol Stripping**: Any `extern` function starting with `libc_` (e.g., `libc_malloc`) will have the prefix removed during the final linking stage.
- **Pointer ABI**: When calling `libc_` functions, Toka's smart pointers (Identity) are automatically converted to raw `ptr` (Soul) to satisfy C calling conventions.

#### C. Control Flow Analysis
Sema must verify that:
-   **Return Check**: All control paths in a non-void function must explicitly return a value.
-   **Unreachable Code**: Detect code after returns or infinite loops (optional but good).

#### D. Parser Debt (Immediate Fixes Needed)
- [x] **Logical Operators**: Implement parsing for `&&` (And) and `||` (Or) in `parseExpr`.
- [x] **Attribute Extraction in Parser**:
    -   Update `parseVariableDecl` to read `IsSwappablePtr` and `HasNull` from the Morphology Token (e.g., `Caret`).
    -   Also updated `UnaryExpr` to propagate these attributes for `is` operator checks.
- [x] **Refined Null Check (`is`)**: Implemented `if ^?p is ^p` syntax support via `is` operator and relaxed Sema checking for this construct.

### 4. Smart Pointer Implementation Guidelines
## 6. Implementation Guidelines for Compiler
1.  **Parser**:
    - Handle `Write Token` suffixing carefully. `ident` vs `ident#`.
    - Distinguish `^Type` from `XOR` operator (if any). context sensitive.
2.  **Semantic Analysis**:
    - **Mutability Check**: Enforce that any LHS of assignment or `&mut` self method call has `#` token.
    - **Trait Check**: `impl` blocks must satisfy trait contracts (warn on `delete`).
    - **Thread Safety**: Verify that any `Token` marked shared variable has a Lock strategy.
    - **Smart Pointer Ownership**:
        - **Unique (`^`)**: Enforce **Move Semantics**. Assignment `auto ^q = ^p` implies move; `p` effectively becomes invalid (though currently implemented as runtime nulling, Sema should eventually track this).
        - **Shared (`~`)**: Enforce type compatibility. Shared pointers can only be initialized from other Shared pointers (copy/incref) or fresh allocations (`new`).
    - **Type Inference**: Correctly propagate `IsUnique`/`IsShared` attributes during type inference (e.g., `auto ~x = ...`).
    - **Permissions & Attributes**:
        - **Object Value Permission**: Cannot upgrade. If the source object is immutable, the destination object cannot become mutable, even on move.
        - **Pointer Permission**: Can be redefined on move. The mutability/nullability of the pointer itself (not the pointed-to value) can change when moved to a new variable.
3.  **CodeGen**:
    - "Immutable Pass-by-Value" -> "Pass-by-Reference" optimization.
    - **Type Aliases**: Resolution must be recursive via a compiler-wide mapping.
    - **Struct vs Pointer Type Resolution**: When resolving types for `Unique` (`^`) or `Shared` (`~`) variables, `resolveType` MUST be called with explicit flags (`IsUnique` or `IsShared`) to return the correct **pointer/handle type** instead of the underlying **Soul struct type**. Failure to do this leads to LLVM IR type mismatches (allocating struct instead of pointer) and crashes during cleanup (e.g., `CreateIsNotNull` on a struct).
    - **Smart Pointer Layout**:
        - **Unique (`^`)**: Implemented as a raw LLVM pointer (`ptr`). Cleanup uses `free` on non-null pointers.
        - **Shared (`~`)**: Implemented as a struct `{ ptr, ptr }` containing the data pointer and a reference count pointer.
    - **Scope Cleanup**: `BlockStmt` must generate cleanup code for all stack-allocated variables.
        - **Shared**: Decrement ref-count; release both data and ref-count memory if zero.
        - **Unique**: Check for null; `free` if not null.
    - **In-place Initialization**: If a complex type (Struct/Tuple) is initialized with a slightly different type (e.g., different sized integers), CodeGen must perform **Member-wise conversion** (creating temporaries and casting each field) rather than a simple bit-cast to ensure data integrity.
    - **Method ABI (Pass-By-Reference)**: 
        - For all `shape` (struct) methods, the `self` parameter MUST be passed as a pointer (`ptr`) in LLVM IR, regardless of whether it is mutable (`#`) or immutable.
        - This prevents structure-by-value copies and ensures ABI compatibility between `callee` and `caller`.
    - **Dead Code & Terminator Safety**: Before emitting any instruction, CodeGen MUST check if the current block is terminated: `if (m_Builder.GetInsertBlock()->getTerminator()) return null`. This is critical for `break/continue/return` logic.
    - **Soul Extraction Requirement (Member Access)**: `MemberExpr` generation MUST call `getEntityAddr` first. If `isImplicitPtr` is true (capture), it loads the soul pointer; otherwise it uses the identity. This is the **Silver Bullet** for preventing corrupted reads.
    - **Nesting Consistency**: Recursive destructuring (e.g. `auto Point(x, y) = p`) must apply the Soul Protocol at each level to ensure deep fields are extracted correctly.
    - **LLVM 17+ Opaque Pointers**: Since LLVM 17 uses `ptr` everywhere, CodeGen MUST pass types explicitly to `CreateLoad`, `CreateStructGEP`, etc. (e.g., `m_Builder.CreateLoad(expectedType, addr)`). Do NOT rely on `getPointerElementType()`.
    - **Multi-Pass Compilation Discovery**:
        - **Pass 1: Discovery**: Register names of Shapes, Functions, and Externs.
        - **Pass 2: Signatures**: Resolve all Type structures and Function/Extern signatures (allowing forward references).
        - **Pass 3: Code Generation**: Emit IR bodies, utilizing fully resolved type metadata.
    - Auto-generation of `drop` glue at scope end.
    - `async/await` state machine generation.

## 7. Example Valid Code
```scala
shape Data (v: i32)

fn process(d: Data) -> void {
    // d is immutable here
    println("{}", d.v)
}

fn main() {
    auto x# = 10         // Mutable int
    x# = 11             // Mutation with token
    
    auto ^p = new Data(v = 0) // Heap alloc
    // p.v = 1 // Error: p points to immutable Data
    
    auto ^p2# = new Data(v = 0)
    p2#.v = 1     // OK: p2 points to mutable Data
    
    process(p2)     // Implicit optimization to clean reference
}
```

### 7.4 Implementation Notes: Unified Morphology
In the implementation of `Parser` and `Sema`, symbols like `*`, `^`, `~`, `&` are all unified as `UnaryExpr` nodes. This allows for a consistent handling of Toka's morphology system. `Sema` distinguishes between them using the operator kind and the `SymbolInfo` structure, ensuring that `*p` (Identity) and `&p` (Reference) are correctly resolved.

## 8. Build and Usage

### 8.1 Building the Compiler
To build the `tokac` compiler:

```bash
mkdir -p build && cd build
cmake ..
make
```

### 8.2 Running Toka Programs
The compiler generates LLVM IR (.ll) which can be executed using `lli` (LLVM interpreter):

```bash
# 1. Compile .tk to .ll
./build/bin/tokac tests/your_file.tk > your_file.ll

# 2. Run with lli
lli your_file.ll
```

Or as a one-line command:
```bash
./build/bin/tokac tests/your_file.tk > tests/your_file.ll && lli tests/your_file.ll
```
