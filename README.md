# Toka Programming Language

**Toka is a modern systems programming language without GC. It combines C-style performance and low-level control with Rust-inspired memory-safety discipline, while aiming for a clean and productive developer experience reminiscent of scripting languages.**

## 🚀 "Show, Don't Tell"

Say goodbye to the cognitive load of explicit `<'a>` lifetime annotations and complex CMake setups. In Toka, high-performance systems code is designed to stay explicit, readable, and disciplined:

```toka
// Everyday Toka: physical-level concurrency, minimalist RAII, and native error propagation
import std/io::println
import std/net::TcpStream
import stdx/net/websocket

// `async` explicitly colors the function; `stream#` lowercase variable with `#` indicates its underlying state will be mutated
fn handle_client(stream#: TcpStream) -> async Result<(), String> {
    // Deep automatic deallocation, no implicit copies, goodbye GC pauses
    auto ws_conn# = websocket::accept_async(stream).await!
    
    // The `!` in `.await!` is Toka's native error propagation operator.
    // Yield control if blocked (await), bubble up instantly on error (!), eliminating verbose `if err` checks.
    ws_conn#.write_text_async("Hello from Toka!").await!
    
    // As it leaves scope, the RAII system silently and safely destroys all sockets and memory.
    return Ok(())
}
```

## 🎯 Is Toka For You?

To respect your time, please verify if Toka fits your needs before diving in:

**✅ It is an excellent choice if:**
*   You need extreme runtime performance and minimal memory footprint (e.g., high-concurrency gateways, game backends, system-level tools).
*   You are tired of Go/Java's GC pauses (STW), but also exhausted by **endlessly fighting the compiler** in Rust, or being forced to take detours just to implement what should be a completely natural logic flow.
*   You want a productive development experience while keeping low-level safety and control close to the machine.

**❌ It might NOT be for you yet if:**
*   Your production environment mandates pure Windows Server deployment (Native Windows support is under active development; WSL2/macOS/Linux are currently recommended).
*   You require massive out-of-the-box business-level ecosystem frameworks (like Spring Boot) — Toka's current ecosystem is more tailored toward systems-level tooling and infrastructure.

## 💎 Core Pillars

### 🛡️ Explicit Resource Safety Without Lifetime Annotations
Pioneering the **Single-Hat Principle** and the **PAL (Pointer Aliasing & Lifecycle) Checker**, Toka makes ownership, borrowing, pointer identity, and mutation intent visible in the source language. The goal is strong compile-time resource safety without explicit lifetime parameters.

### ⚡ Zero-Cost Abstraction & Native C Interop
Built on **LLVM 20**, Toka has **No Garbage Collection (No GC)**. Its native layout and FFI-oriented design are intended to make interop with the existing C ecosystem (like SQLite or OpenGL) direct and predictable.

### 🚦 Transparent Concurrency & Error Flow
No implicit "black magic schedulers." Toka makes function costs physically explicit: standard functions and `async` (yielding) functions have clear color boundaries. Paired with the native `!` error propagation operator, error handling and async scheduling stay visible in the function signature and call site.

### 📦 Integrated Modern Tooling
Toka includes the `toka` CLI for project workflows such as `toka run`, `toka build`, and package resolution based on `package.tk` / `build.tk`, keeping everyday build steps close to the language.

## 🌟 Deep Dive: Attribute Tokens & Soul-Identity Duality

Toka eliminates hidden states by making memory properties explicit through **orthogonal suffix tokens**. Developers can instantly understand the underlying memory structure and lifecycle just by glancing at a variable definition.

### Key Innovations

**1. Syntactic RAII (Native Smart Pointers)**
Toka elevates **Smart Pointers to Core Syntax**. "Lifecycle Management" is internalized as the language's breath.
*   **^T (Unique)** and **~T (Shared)** exist as native grammatical constructs, making RAII the zero-visual-cost default pattern.

**2. Soul-Identity Duality**
Toka philosophically separates an object into its **Soul (Content/Value)** and **Identity (Extension/Address)**.
*   **Precise Semantics**: Access the Soul via Borrow (`&`) and manipulate the Identity via Pointer (`*`), completely eliminating the semantic ambiguity between "reference assignment" and "content modification" found in traditional languages.

**3. Orthogonal Decoupling of Mutability and Nullability**
Say goodbye to the keyword soup of `const volatile unsigned`. Toka strictly defines attribute ownership:
*   **Mutability is a property of the variable (`#`)**: Represents identity transfer or content modification.
*   **Nullability is a property of the type (`?`)**: Represents the potential non-existence of the entity in memory.
*   **Visual Formula**: declarations such as `auto ^p = new Node(...)`, `auto x# = 1`, or the rare full form `auto nul ^#node#: Node? = null` expose ownership, mutability, and nullability at the syntax level.

**4. @encap Explicit Encapsulation & Resource Safety**
Toka makes normal `shape` members transparent by default, but heavily restricts resource-holding structs (like Files or Sockets) using `@encap`.
*   **Permission & Lifecycle Binding**: Inside an `impl Type@encap` block, you must explicitly expose interfaces (`pub`). More importantly, this is the *only* legal place to define lifecycle methods like `drop`, fundamentally preventing resource tampering and memory leaks at the contract level.

**5. Explicit Control Flow & Error Propagation**
Toka favors explicit control-flow contracts: `match` is checked for exhaustive handling, `guard` makes null and none checks visible, and the postfix `!` operator propagates `Result` / `Option` failures without hiding the early-return path.

### Token System Table

| Token | Meaning (Value/Content) | Meaning (Identity/Address) |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| `#` | **Writable**: Can modify fields | **Swappable**: Can point elsewhere |
| `?` | **Nullable**: Value is `none` | **Nullable**: Identity is `null` |
| `!` | **Writable & Nullable** | **Swappable & Nullable** |
| `^` | - | **Unique Pointer** (Ownership) |
| `~` | - | **Shared Pointer** (Ref Counted) |
| `&` | **Borrow**: View into Value | **Reference**: View into Soul |
| `*` | - | **Raw Pointer** (No Ownership) |

## Inspirations & Lineage

Toka is a modern systems programming language built on the shoulders of giants. It was born not to reinvent the wheel, but to explore the optimal balance between **high performance** and **developer experience**, building upon the wisdom of its predecessors.

### 1. C & C++ (Modern C++)
**Core Inspiration: Systems Control, Smart Pointers & RAII**
Toka's memory management mechanism is a direct descendant of Modern C++ (C++11/14+). Toka bakes the semantics of `std::unique_ptr` and `std::shared_ptr` directly into its **core prefix grammar** (`^T` / `~T`), making RAII a zero-visual-cost default standard.

### 2. Rust
**Core Inspiration: The Borrowing Discipline & Memory Safety**
Rust proved that memory safety without garbage collection is achievable. Toka is inspired by Rust's strict borrowing discipline, but it explores a different surface syntax: explicit resource morphology, PAL checks, and dependency routing instead of user-written lifetime parameters such as `<'a>`.

### 3. Haskell / ML Family
**Core Inspiration: Typeclasses & Orthogonality**
Toka's Trait system spiritually inherits from Haskell's Typeclasses. We champion the complete decoupling of "Data Definition" (`shape`) from "Behavior Implementation" (`impl`).

### 4. Swift / Kotlin / C#
**Core Inspiration: Null Safety**
To address "The Billion Dollar Mistake," Toka adopts **Explicit Null Safety**. Using the suffix modifier (`?`), null pointer checks are enforced at the type system level.

### 5. Python
**Core Inspiration: Readability & Productivity**
Toka strives to bring the developer experience of scripting languages to systems programming, aiming to make systems code as readable and approachable as high-level scripts.

### 6. Extended Gratitude
Programming language design is an endless exploration across a vast universe of ideas. Toka embraces the collective wisdom of the entire open-source community and maintains the utmost reverence for all pioneers who have pushed the boundaries of computer science forward.
